<h1>Non-destructive test robot for tile void with use of SoundProcessing</h1>
<p>
  It is a research on non-destructive test for void of tile wall by sound impact test. With identification of different frequencies segments and some pretrained dataset from MatLab, the uni-directional microphone will collect and analyse the data of sound impact and return results of hollow or solid area in a tile within around 1 second.

<h2><u><b>Operation Instructions</b></u></h2>
<p>
  When the data process program in computer, a GUI will allow users to set up parameters. When the start button clicks, the solenoid hammer on robot will impact on tile wall and a uni-directional microphone will collect data and send the audio matrix for processing using algorithms and return different color LED light with different result. The process can repeat and the algorithm of sound detection is not volunerable with environment noise.</pre>
<p>
  The robot is also mounted with HC05 bluetooth module with Arduino board which is used for hardware control to accept bluetooth commands from bluetooth controller mobile app for moving direction of the robot to check the next tiles.
